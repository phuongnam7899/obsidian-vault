-  If you have a piece of ==data on which you cannot act==, it’s a vanity metric
- 8 Vanity metrics to watch out:
	- **Number of hits**: If you have a site with many objects on it, this will be a big number. Count people instead.
	- **Number of page views**: Unless your business model depends on page views (i.e., display advertising inventory), you should count people instead
	- **Number of unique visitors**. All this shows you is how many people saw your home page. It **tells you nothing about what they did**, why they stuck around, **or if they left**.
	- **Number of followers/friends/likes**: It's useless unless you can get them to do something useful for you
	- **Time on site/number of pages**: If customers spend a lot of time on your support or complaints pages, that’s probably a bad thing
	- **Emails collected**: until you know how many will open your emails (and act on what’s inside them), this isn’t useful
	- **Number of downloads**: downloads alone don’t lead to real value. Measure activations, account creations, or something else.
