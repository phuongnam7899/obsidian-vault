# Three Types of Personas

## Proto Personas

- Created without new research
- Based on existing knowledge and assumptions
- Quick to create but less reliable

## Qualitative Personas

- Created through solid exploratory qualitative research (such as [user interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/))
- Uses small-to-medium sample size
- Segments users based on shared:
  - Attitudes
  - Goals
  - Pain points
  - Expectations

## Statistical Personas

- Combines Qualitative and Quantitative Research[^1]
- Process:
  1. Conduct exploratory qualitative research to identify recurring themes among users
  2. Create surveys based on qualitative data to collect quantitative data at scale
  3. Analyze data to validate and refine personas
