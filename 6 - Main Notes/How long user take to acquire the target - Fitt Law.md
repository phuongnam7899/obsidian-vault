> [!info] **The time to acquire** a target = the **distance to** x **size** of the target.

- Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.
- Touch targets should have ample spacing between them.
- Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.
