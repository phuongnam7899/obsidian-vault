- Cloud computing allows clients to access services on demand
- Key characteristics:
  - Avoid upfront investment
  - Pay only for what you use
  - Elastic resource allocation

## Deployment Models

- **Cloud-based deployment**:
  - Run all application parts on cloud
  - Migrate existing applications to cloud
  - Create new applications on cloud
- **On-premises (Private cloud) deployment**:
  - Use virtualization and resource management tools
  - Use application management to control resources
- **Hybrid deployment**:
  - Combine cloud and on-premises
  - Connect services across both environments

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- No upfront investment (servers, data centers, system management)
- Focus on applications and customers rather than infrastructure
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Reduced gap between wanting and having resources
- Fast global access
- Cost efficiency through pay-on-demand and aggregated usage
