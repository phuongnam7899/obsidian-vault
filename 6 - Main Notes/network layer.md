# Network Layer (Layer 3)

The Network Layer is the third layer of the [[OSI Model]], responsible for:

## Key Functions

- Logical addressing ([[IP address]])
- Routing between networks
- Packet forwarding
- Path determination
- Quality of Service (QoS)

## Main Protocols

- [[IPv4]] (Internet Protocol version 4)
  - 32-bit addresses
  - Most widely used
- [[IPv6]] (Internet Protocol version 6)
  - 128-bit addresses
  - Next generation protocol
- [[ICMP]] (Internet Control Message Protocol)
  - Network diagnostics
  - Error reporting

## Key Concepts

- Subnetting
- [[CIDR range|CIDR]] notation
- Routing tables
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- [[IP ranges|IP addressing schemes]]

## Common Network Devices

- Routers
- Layer 3 switches
- Multilayer switches
