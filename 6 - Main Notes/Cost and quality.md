In reducing cost or raising product and service quality, remember above all that ==equal cost does not lead to equal customer satisfaction==. A few parts of cost are tremendously productive; but most cost has little or no relationship to what customers value. Identify, treasure and multiply the few productive costs; and get rid of the rest.
