# Reinforcing Feedback
- Given when we want someone to ==keep doing a certain positive behavior==
- Examples:
	- Something I really appreciate about you is....
	- I think you did a great job when you … it showed that you had….
	- I would love to see you do more of X as it relates to Y
	- I really think you have a superpower around X
	- One of the things I admire about you is…
	- I can see you’re having a positive impact in…
# Redirecting
- We’re telling someone that we want them to ==stop doing X and start doing Y==
- Different with negative feedback: only be telling them to stop doing something
- Examples:
	- I’d like to give you some feedback, is now a good time?
	- Do you have a moment to catch up about how X went?
	- Can we debrief on X?
	- Can we talk about X - what do you think is going well or what didn’t go well?

# Tips to make feedback
- Be conscious of ==timing==: when they are in the best mindset to get the feedback
- Be ==prepared==: 
	- What is the ==purpose== of your feedback 
	- What do you want the ==outcome== to be
	- ==How== do you think they could do so ==to achieve== this outcome
- Provide ==specific examples==: Specific feedback serves as a basis for measuring growth and guiding future behavior
- Make feedback ==actionable== (and future-focused when possible)
- Make employee feedback a ==regular== process
