-  Principles/laws of human perception that describe ==how humans group similar elements==, ==recognize patterns== and ==simplify complex images== when we perceive objects. 
- Can apply this to make things ==easier to understand== and ==aesthetically pleasing==
- There're 4 principles:
## Closure (Reification)
- We ==prefer complete shapes==, so we ==automatically fill in gaps== between elements to perceive a complete image. Thatâ€™s how we ==can see the whole first==

## Common Region
- We ==group elements== that are ==in the same closed region==

## Figure/Ground (Multi-stability)
- We ==dislike uncertainty==, so we ==look for solid, stable items==

## Proximity (Emergence)
- We ==group closer-together elements==, separating them from those farther apart
