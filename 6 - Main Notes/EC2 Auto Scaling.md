# EC2 Auto Scaling

EC2 Auto Scaling automatically adjusts computing capacity to maintain consistent performance at the lowest possible cost.

## Key Features

- Automatically scales EC2 capacity up or down based on demand
- Monitors the health of running instances
- Replaces unhealthy instances automatically
- Balances capacity across Availability Zones

## Scaling Types

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Responds to changing demand
- **Predictive Scaling**: Automatically schedules the right number of instances based on predicted demand

Auto Scaling helps ensure applications have the right amount of capacity to handle varying workloads efficiently, eliminating the need to manually provision for peak capacity.
