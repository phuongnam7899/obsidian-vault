- EC2 Auto Scaling automatically adjusts computing capacity based on demand
- Key capabilities:
  - Automatically increases/decreases the number of EC2 instances based on defined conditions
  - Ensures you have the correct number of instances for the current workload

## Auto Scaling Methods

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Responds to changing demand by scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization
- **Predictive Scaling**: Uses machine learning to forecast traffic patterns and schedule scaling ahead of time

## Benefits

- Improved fault tolerance by replacing unhealthy instances
- Increased application availability during demand spikes
- Cost optimization by scaling down during periods of low demand
- Better resource utilization across the deployment
