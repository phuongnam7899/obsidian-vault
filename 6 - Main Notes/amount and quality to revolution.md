In order to mount a revolution, ==numbers== are ==never enough==. Revolutions are ==usually made by small== networks of ==agitators== rather than by the masses. If you want to launch a revolution, don’t ask yourself, ‘How many people support my ideas?’ Instead, ask yourself, ‘How many of my supporters are capable of effective collaboration?’
