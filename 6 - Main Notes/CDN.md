- Content Delivery Network
- Is a geographically distributed network of servers which designed to serve content based on user location
- Content included:
	- Images
	- Videos
	- PDF
	- Document
	- HTML/CSS
- Why it could help?
	- When user need to load content, the longer the distance, the slower loading speed
	- The CDN stored copies of the content at the Edge servers around the world
- Benefit:
	- Reduce latency
	- Reduce website load because the content loaded by CDN -> reduce the web server traffic
	- Scalability
	- Reliability: when a edge server failed, others can serve the content
