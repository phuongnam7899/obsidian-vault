# TCP vs UDP Comparison

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### Advantages

- ✓ Reliable delivery through acknowledgments
- ✓ Guaranteed packet order
- ✓ Comprehensive error checking
- ✓ Flow control to prevent overwhelming receivers

### Disadvantages

- × Higher latency due to connection setup
- × More overhead from control packets
- × Higher bandwidth usage

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### Advantages

- ✓ Lower latency (no connection setup)
- ✓ Minimal overhead
- ✓ Efficient for real-time applications

### Disadvantages

- × No delivery guarantees
- × No packet order guarantees
- × Basic error checking only
- × No flow control

## Use Cases

### TCP

- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP)
- File transfer (FTP)
- Database connections

### UDP

- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- VoIP
- DNS queries
