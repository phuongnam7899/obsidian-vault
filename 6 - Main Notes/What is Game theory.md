Tragedy of the commons:
	- when each person focus on their benefit, the result will be disadvantage for all
- Example:
	- A and B, each has a fishing lake that have 100 fish, which can be haverst 10 each month
	- Between A and B house, there's a public lake that has 100 fish, and also can haverst 10 each month
	- The best case is that A and B haverst 10 each month, and they will have 20/month -> 240/year
	- But if A and B both not belieave in the other, they will ends up haverst 50 fish in first month => in first year, each has only 170 => Not a best case
