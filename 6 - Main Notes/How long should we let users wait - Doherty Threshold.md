> [!info] Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

- Provide system feedback within 400ms in order to keep usersâ€™ attention and increase productivity.
- Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting.
- Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background.
- Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their accuracy
- Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time
