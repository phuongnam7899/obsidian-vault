- Elastic Network Interface
- A logical component in [[Amazon VPC]] that represent [[virtual network card]]
- Each ENI has following attributes:
	- 1 primary private [[IPv4]]
	- 1 or more secondary IPv4
	- 1 Elastic IP per private IPv4
	- 1 Public IPv4
	- 1 or more [[Security group]]
	- A [[MAC address]]
- Can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly on EC2 instances for failover
- ENI is bounded to a specific AZ

# How to?
- Create new ENI
- Attach it to instance

# Use cases
- Network security
	- Different security groups for different types of traffic
		- Web traffic (ports 80/443) on one ENI
		- Database traffic (port 3306) on another ENI
		- Database traffic (port 3306) on another ENI
- Multiple network
	- Connect toÂ different subnets
	- Access to different VPCs
	- Mix of public and private networks
	- Different routing rules per interface
- Low-budget high-availability
	- Move ENI toÂ backup instance during failure (Keep sameÂ IP address when moving) -> quick recovering
- Dual-homed instances
	- Instance presentÂ in multiple subnets
