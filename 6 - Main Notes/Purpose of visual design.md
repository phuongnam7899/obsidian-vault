Visual design aims to ==improve a design’s/product’s aesthetic appeal== and ==usability== with suitable images, typography, space, layout and color[^1]. 
- Visual design is about ==more than aesthetics==. Designers place elements carefully to create interfaces that ==optimize user experience== and ==drive conversion==.
- You use visual design to create and organize elements to:
	- Lead the user’s eye to an item’s functionality
	- Make the aesthetics consistent.
- Your ==enemy== here ==is== ==user uncertainty==. If your users have to stop and think about your design, they won’t trust.  =>  visual designer should show then the right thing in the right way.
- A major factor in visual design is that you work to ==accommodate user limitations== such as cognitive load
