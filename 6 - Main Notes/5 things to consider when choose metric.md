- **Qualitative** vs **quantitative** metrics
	- [[Qualitative metrics]] are unstructured, anecdotal, revealing, and hard to aggregate
	- [[Quantitative metrics]] involve numbers and statistics, and provide hard numbers but less insight.
- **Vanity** vs **actionable** metrics
	- [[Vanity metrics]] might make you feel good, but they **don’t change how you act**
	- Actionable metrics change your behavior by helping you pick a course of action.
	- Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do differently based on this information?”
	- Examples:
		- “total signups.” is vanity metric because it's increase overtime
		- "percentage of user who are active" is actionable metric because if you make change to business, the number change
		- “number of users acquired over a specific time period.” is actinable because it help to compare marketing approaches
- **Exploratory** versus **reporting** metrics:
	![[Pasted image 20241106212015.png]]
	- Exploratory metrics are speculative and try to **find unknown insights** to give you the upper hand
	-  Reporting metrics **keep you up to date with normal, managerial, day-to-day operations.**
- **Leading** versus **lagging** metrics:
	- Leading metrics give you a **predictive understanding of the future**
	- Lag-ging metrics **explain the past**
- **Correlated** versus **causal** metrics:
	- If two metrics change together, they’re correlated, but if one metric causes another metric to change, they’re causal
