### Market orders
- Buy/sell ==IMMEDIATELY==, with ==ANY PRICE== 
- Totally affected by spread[^1]. For example, when current price is 100 and make a market order to buy, when the order is received by system, the price may have been raised to 110 => slippage is 10
### Limit orders
- You ==set the amount== of stock ==and the price== that you want to buy/sell
- ==Might never been matched== or only ==matched a part== of order
### Marketable limit orders
- Buy/sell ==IMMEDIATELY==, but you ==set the acceptable price range== to match
### Stop orders
- To close the position, in long (buy) position, stop order is sell, in short (sell) position, stop order is buy
