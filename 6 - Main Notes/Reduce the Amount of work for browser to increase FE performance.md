# Step 1: Remove redundant
- [[Minify technique]] - remove redundant characters
- [[Tree shaking technique]] - eliminate unused code
- [[Remove redundant size of images]]
# Step 2: Split to be lazy
- After the 1st step, we ensure that all codes in the bundled file are not useless for the application. But the fact is: Users might not want to see and use all things in your app at once
- Analogy: Your app is a restaurant with 100 dishes in the menu, but each customer could only order some of them
- -> Donâ€™t make your chef cook all dishes until customers actually order

- Solution: only load what and when users need
- Techniques:
	- [[Code Splitting for Lazy Loading Codes]]
	- [[Lazy loading images or videos]]
	- [[Lazy Rendering with Virtual Scroll]]
	- [[Lazy data fetching]]
# Step 3: Compress
- After we ensure all things are the needed, we can compress the file to make it even lighter -> reduce the load time (and the bandwidth also)
- You can choose between gzip - compatible with more browser and brotli - compress more effectively
