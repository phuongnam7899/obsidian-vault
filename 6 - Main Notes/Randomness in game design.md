# Why?
- To make variety -> more interesting
- For player not to replay to pass -> need to master the underlie game mechanics, replan more frequently
- Balance the gameplay (lucky and limit a part of the pure skill)
# 2 types of randomness
## Input randomness
- Happen before the players made decision (map, cards, roll dices then choose how to spend,...)
## Output randomness
- Happen after player made decision -> luck take over (loot box, crit rate,...)
- Advance: to limit the maximum fail in row

=> Both are important, but need to balance and limited
