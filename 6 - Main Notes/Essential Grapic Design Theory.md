# 3. Symmetry Order

-   A design composition should not provide a sense of disorder and imbalance ⇒ Viewers waste time thinking, to fill the imbalance one ⇒ Raise the cognitive load
-   Focus on the message that users need to know / the main problem that they need to deal with, if they need to fix sub-conscious problems ⇒ design has problems
