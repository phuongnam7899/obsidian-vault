- Happen when a person have conflict in actions, belief, core values, attitude, thought
- Examples:
	- You buy find a thing very important -> buy it -> then it become useless -> self question about previous decision => Conflict between ==action x action==
	- You used to believe in God -> Learn about technology -> Find some irrational points -> Confict between ==belief x belief==
	- You believe health is important -> you smoke -> conflict between ==action x belief==
- Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. 
- In fact, it ==is a vital asset==. Had people been unable to hold contradictory beliefs and values, it would probably have been impossible ==to establish and maintain any human culture==.
