# Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **No upfront investment**: Eliminate costs for servers, data centers, system managers. Only pay for what you use.
- **Focus on applications and customers**: Concentrate on core business needs rather than infrastructure management.
- **Elastic resource allocation**: Scale resources in/out as needed without predicting capacity requirements.
- **Reduced procurement time**: Small gap between wanting and having resources (compared to on-premises procurement).
- **Global access**: Fast access to services from anywhere in the world.
- **Cost efficiency**: Lower costs through pay-on-demand model and aggregated usage pricing.

These benefits provide both technical and business advantages, enabling organizations to be more agile and cost-effective.
