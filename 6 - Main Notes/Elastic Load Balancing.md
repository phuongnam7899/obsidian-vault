# Elastic Load Balancing

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed.

## Key Features

- Automatically distributes traffic across multiple resources (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses)
- Handles varying loads of application traffic
- Provides a single point of contact for clients
- Increases application availability through redundancy
- Can work across multiple Availability Zones for greater fault tolerance

## Benefits

- High availability and automatic scaling
- Security features including integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption
- Health checks to detect unhealthy resources
- Seamless integration with other AWS services

Elastic Load Balancing works in conjunction with EC2 Auto Scaling to ensure applications have the right capacity and distribution of traffic.
