#### Tips
- Focus on one thing at a time: That gives you a chance to explain your
feedback in full, and your employee a chance to listen and reflect.
- Direct your feedback to the design, not the designer
- Highlight real examples
- Make it timely: so that they can easily connect the feedback to their action
- Give feedback regularly
- Avoid sandwich technique feedback
#### How to prevent designers from becoming defensive
- Help your team feel ownership:
	- People are more receptive to ideas they came up with themselves
	- .Instead of imposing solutions on your team, ask them to help you brainstorm ideas for resolving the problem
- Acknowledge your own subjectivity: do not feedback in term off right or wrong
	- Example: "“I could be wrong, but it seems like there’s not enough whitespace in this design. What do you think?”"
