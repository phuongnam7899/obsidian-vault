## Key characteristic of Cloud computing
- ==On-demand self service==
	- Ease of provisioning computing resources 
	- User can provision computing capabilities: Server, Network, Databases
- ==Broad network access==:
	- Services are available over the network
- ==Resource pooling==
	- Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple customers -> economy of scale
- ==Rapid elasticity==
	- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released (may be automatically)
- ==Measured Services==
	- Cloud system automatically control and optimize resources usage
	- Leverage metering capability at some level of abstraction -> only pay for what you use
