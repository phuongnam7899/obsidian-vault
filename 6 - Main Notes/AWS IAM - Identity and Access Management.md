- Authentication mechanism - Password policy that could be setup - Minimum length - Require specfic chars: - Upper/lower - numbers - non-alphanumeric chars - Allow change password - Frequency of password change
  ![[Pasted image 20250329142820.png]] - MFA (Multi factor authetication): - = password you know + device you own - MFA options in AWS: - Virtual MFA device: GG autenticator, Authy - Universal 2nd factor (U2F) Sercurity key: YubiKey - Hardware key Fob MFA device (Provided by Gelmato) - Hardware key Fob MFA device for AWS GovCloud (provided by SurePassID) - How to access AWS, 3 options: - AWS management cosole (protected by password + MFA) - AWS CLI: protected by Access Key - AWS SDK: protected by access key - Access key: - generated by user - don't share it

> [!i] Best practices:
>
> - Use root user (first user) to create another user (User A) -> use user B to create other other. Avoid using root user
> - One physical user = one AWS user
> - Attach policy to group instead of individual
> - For policies: follow the security principle of least privilege
> - Create strong password policy
> - Enforce using MFA
> - Use roles for giving perms to AWS services
> - Use access key for Programatic access (CLI/SDK)
> - Audit permission using IAM Credential Report and IAM Access Advisor
> - Never share user/access key
