### Description:

Stimulate a simple Traffic light with some function:

-   Show light color
-   Change color automatically ( red → green → yellow → red → ... )
-   Each color has difference time to turn into next color

### Notes:

-   Color code is of your choice
-   Time to turn into next color is of your choice (but it should be different such as red → green: 5s, green → yellow: 3s, yellow → red: 4s)

### Hint:

-   JS:
    -   Use getElementByID[^1]
    -   Use setTimeOut() to turn into next color
    -   Change innerHTML[^1] of element to render light
