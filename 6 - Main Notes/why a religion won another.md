Why did Marx and Lenin succeed where Hong and the Mahdi failed? ==Not because== socialist humanism was ==philosophically more sophisticated== than Islamic and Christian theology, but rather ==because== Marx and Lenin ==devoted more attention== to understanding the ==technological and economic realities== of their time ==than==  ==ancient texts and prophetic dreams.==
