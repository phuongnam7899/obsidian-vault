- SaaS stands for Software as a Service.
- It is a delivery model for software applications where the ==provider hosts the software== and makes it ==available to customers== over the internet, ==rather than customers installing the software== on their own computers. 
- ==Customers subscribe to the service== on a monthly or yearly basis and can access the software from any device with an internet connection. 
- Examples of SaaS applications include customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and human resource management (HRM) systems.
- SaaS has become popular due to its cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and ease of use.
