As we checked the code, the PMA seems not have any features related to sending email, so we will need to create it from scratch. And we need to decide the mail-sending service to use. Currently we have some options, and we'll compare them in 3 criteria - Price, Security and Ease of implementation:

Our recommendation: Azure Communication Service because it's best matches with our current Azure Ecosystem, best in security, and the cost for our low volume needs is very low (If you want a completely free service for our low volume need -> Choose Brevo)
