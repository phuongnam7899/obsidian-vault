- The root of explanation is to create ==relations among== the ==thing that we want to explain== with the ==things that the audience already known==
	- The more relations, the more understandable and rememberable is the explanation 
	- Each audience might have different "already known" things -> a good explanation with someone might not good with another -> need to find out what they known first
