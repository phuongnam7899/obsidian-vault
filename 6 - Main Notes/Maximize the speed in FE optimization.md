# Technique 1: Caching

>[!w] This technique might be put in Strategy #1 because, at its deepest, caching is reducing the distance. But the idea of caching = faster is easier to remember, like the Pythagorean theorem, no need to prove it again to use. So let it be here

- Caching is fast, but the down sides are:
	- Inconsistence if the data updated regularly
	- Limited amount of data to be stored (mostly because of the cost)
- => Only use it for data that is regularly used and less updated
- There're some [[Browser cache types]] that could be used
# Technique 2: Multi Thread
- Javascript is single-thread (called the main thread)
- Everything that runs synchronously will block the main thread -> user can not interact with the UI
- Hereâ€™s web workers come to help processing the heavy calculation tasks in independent threads
