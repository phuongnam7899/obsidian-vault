# Title: Strategy 1: Reduce the Amount of Work

In the end of part 1, I state that "To increase performance, we could either increase the velocity OR reduce the distance (things that need to be processed)". But which one to choose?
My choice is inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RRZGH7VVIi8 
-> In short: You won't need to try running faster if you can find shorter way to go. 

So, in this part, I will tell about techniques to reduce the amount of work that browser need to complete the CRP. And the browser will thank you for that
