# Title: Strategy 1: Reduce the Amount of Work

At the end of part 1, I stated "To increase performance, we could either increase the velocity OR reduce the distance (things that need to be processed)". But which one to start with?
My choice is inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RRZGH7VVIi8 
-> Summary: You won't need to try running faster if you can find a shorter way. 

So, in this part, I will write about techniques to reduce the amount of work a browser needs to complete the CRP, which could increase the performance of the web application.
