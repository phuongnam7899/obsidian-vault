# Title: CRP - The core of Front-end Optimization

I used to chase after every performance tip and trick I came across, hoping to make the applications faster. But they're like butterfliesâ€”when mindlessly chasing them, I wasn't aware of the bigger picture, then ended up getting lost when there're too many of tips appear. And when I first knew about the CRP, I felt it like a map for connecting all of them, and help me to optimize more strategically.
That's why I chose it as the starting point of this series.
