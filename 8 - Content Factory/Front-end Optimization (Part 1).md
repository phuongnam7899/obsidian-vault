# Title: CRP - The core of Front-end Optimization

I used to chase after every **performance tip and trick** I came across, hoping to make my front-end applications faster.

But here’s the problem: tips and tricks are like scattered breadcrumbs—they lead you somewhere, but rarely to the big picture. I felt like a child chasing butterflies, each one promising answers, until I realized I was lost in a forest of fragmented advice.

That’s when I discovered the **Critical Rendering Path (CRP)**—the foundation of front-end optimization. Instead of wandering, I finally understood **what truly matters** and how to optimize methodically.
