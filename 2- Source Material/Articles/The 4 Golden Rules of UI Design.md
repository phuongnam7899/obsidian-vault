## 1. Let user as much control as possible in the interface
### Why?
- User will be ==comfortable== when they have control
- User will ==learn and master== the product using ==faster==
### How?
- Make actions ==reversable==
	- user less fear about failure -> able to explore more
	- Example: undo/redo
- Make the interface ==easily to navigate==
	- Give user ==hints== about ==where they are==
	- User could ==predict== what will happen when make an action
	- Examples: Bread crumb,  page title,...
- Give user ==feedback== of what they've just done
	- Should be easy to understand
	- Should be easy to be noticed
	- Example: Button changes color, notification,...
- Give user information of ==what is the system doing==
	- User will be more forgiving if they know what is the product doing 
	- Example: user could wait longer with the progress loading status
- Serve users with different skill levels:
	- Newbie need clear
	- Advanced user need fast
	- Examples: shortcuts for advanced, tutorial tooltip for newbie
## Make user comfortable when use the product
- Not show what are not helpful for user
	- Imagine user attention/cognitive load is food and each elements on screen is a starving animal
- Don't make user re-enter things that they did before
	- To minimize the work of user -> increase the productivity
	- Example: save data to autofill 
- Avoid things that are hard to understood by users
	- Example: Subject-specific/System term, unlabeled,...
- Make things more understandable:
	- Let the behavior like what user has get used with: real-world metaphors, similar with common behaviors in other product 
- Make elements easily to access:
	- Apply Fitts's Law: Time to acquire = distance from target x size of target
	- Notice about users' different conditions when using the product:
		- Lack of vision
		- Hard to hear
		- ...
## Reduce cognitive load
Cognitive load is like mental power needed to use a product
- ==Chunking/grouping== for complex action/information
	- Group item that have same type of function => make them similar
	- Sorting elements => increase predictability
- Create ==hierarchy== for UI
	- By color
	- By size
	- By positioning
- ==Reduce== number of ==actions==
- ==Reduce== number of ==choices==
- Recognition > Recall
## Make element consistency
- Visual consistency: make sure same style = same meaning
	- Color meaning
	- Font
	- Layout
	- Images
